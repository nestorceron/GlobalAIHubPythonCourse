    "# Intro - Feedback on the quizzes\n",
    "First, let me thank you for the class. It was a great class and Tuana (the instructor) did a fantastic job.\n",
    "Second, I documented some issues below related to the quizzes. My intention is to provide constructive feedback, so in the future there are better programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that spirit in mind, I believe that good programming techniques should be part of the class and specially the quizzes. In python, if I forget a colon at the end of a line, the program will not run. Precision and correctness is essencial in programming. The code in many questions will not run in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naming of variables and functions is also important. Variables as instances of objects interact with each other and you need to implement good naming conventions. Calling something \"square\", when it represents a \"square-root\" is not correct. The teaching should focus then on the naming and not in tricking you that you can follow a weird name. That is how bugs are created in software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of this is the question for if-else statements. Three variables with three nested ifs and each evaluation using all three variables.  When do you find code like this in an application? Never ! It is a bad programming technique. The teaching should focus on simplifying that nested if, so you can understand and other programmers can follow along when they see your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking everything into account, it was a great class. Your efforts to bring technology to all parts of the world are noble and I hope that my comments are a small contribution to make the class better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy coding,\n",
